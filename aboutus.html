              <h2>About Us</h2>
              <p>
                Mavericks is a group of enthusiastic friends from Monash University, 
                who formed a team together in order to compete in The Grand Challenge 
                (https://thegrandchallenge.mdec.my/), a hackathon organized by MDEC 
                (Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation). The theme of the competition 
                was Adaptive Lighting for parking areas.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the 3-day-2-night event, we meticulously considered as many factors 
                possible to produce a solution that is both efficient and effective. 
                During this time, we realized that we worked excellent as a team and 
                were able to capitalize on each of our expertise in different areas 
                to finally arrive at a champion solution.
              </p>

              <p>
                After the competition, we allocated our time to further improve our 
                solution because we are passionate about ensuring the highest quality 
                and durability of our product. Furthermore, not only is the solution 
                profitable and durable, but it helps to save the Earth at the same time! 
              </p>
              <p>
                Currently, the Mavericks is focusing on perfecting our adaptive lighting 
                solution so that it will work for any space one can imagine, like offices, 
                warehouses, homes, garages, etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                We believe our solution will play a big part in reducing energy wastage as 
                the usage of non-adaptive LED lamps as a light source is still widespread. 
                We understand that it may be rather costly and troublesome to make these 
                changes. Thus, Mavericks offers a solution – Green Light Project – that not 
                only enables you to reduce energy wastage, but also reduce costs as a result!
              </p>
              <p>
                Therefore, come join us on our journey to Greenify the World, One Light Bulb at a Time.
